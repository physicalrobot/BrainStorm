# BrainStorm App

Scroll down to start using the app. You'll find an About page as well as a Contact page you can click on. The Home page will simply remove the information from the other two links and revert the site back to default. 

This app was created to help improve my efficiency when planning out a program. I can come up with a quick blue print while testing out some css and javascript. 

I also find myself listening to lofi music everytime I code, so I also added feature that toggles lofi music to help set the mood. You can find it if you scroll further down past the image.
