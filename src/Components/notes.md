Thanks for meeting with me today! You built a great app!
I would recommend spending time to work on:
- Controlled components
- Destructuring (with objects and arrays)
- Switch
- Make sure there are no warnings in the console
- Update your form so that “text” is not set to an array
Please book another review once you have implemented the feedback you received. I encourage you to check in with your Cohort Lead for support as well. I wish you the best as you continue your program!
